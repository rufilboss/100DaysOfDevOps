* AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows

    * AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows let you define a schedule for when to perform potentially disruptive actions on your instances such as patching an operating system, updating drivers, or installing software or patches. Each Maintenance Window has a schedule, a maximum duration, a set of registered targets (the instances that are acted upon), and a set of registered tasks. You can add tags to your Maintenance Windows when you create or update them.
