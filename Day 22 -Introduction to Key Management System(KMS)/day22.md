* What is KMS?

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.

* Advantage

    * We can use IAM Policies for KMS access
    * AWS Services(RDS,S3,DynamoDB,EBS…) integrated directly with KMS [**here**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/service-integration.html)
    * It uses FIPS 140–2 compliant hardware module to manage access to key material.
    * Integrated fully with CloudTrail for auditing function

* Concepts

    * KMS stores Customer Master Keys(CMK) which is a logical representation of a key.
    * Key can be generated by KMS or imported.
    * The encrypted data keys are stored with the data
    * CMK never leaves KMS and never leaves a region
    * CMK can encrypt or decrypt data up to 4KB in size.
