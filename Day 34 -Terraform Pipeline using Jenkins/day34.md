* What is the Pipeline?

    * A pipeline is typically referred to as a part of Continuous Integration and itâ€™s mostly used to merge developer changes into code mainline.

* Why do we need a pipeline?

    * Test changes before pushing to Production
    * Another pair of eyes in terms of approval
    * Logging to see who and when someone pushed the changes
    * Separate workspace/tfstate for Development and Production Environment

* Pipeline Architecture
