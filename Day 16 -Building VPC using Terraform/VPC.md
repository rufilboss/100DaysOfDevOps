##### What is VPC?

Without going to all the nitty-gritty details of VPC, first, let’s try to understand VPC in the simplest term. Before the cloud era, we use to have datacenters where we deploy all of our infrastructures. You can think of VPC as your datacentre in a cloud but rather than spending months or weeks to set up that datacenter it’s now just a matter of minutes(API calls). It’s the place where you define your network which closely resembles your own traditional data centers with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure provided by AWS.

* Today we are going to build the first half of the equation i.e VPC
* Once we create the VPC using AWS Console, these things created for us by-default
    * Network Access Control List(NACL)
    * Security Group
    * Route Table
* We need to take care of
    * Internet Gateways
    * Subnets
    * Custom Route Table
