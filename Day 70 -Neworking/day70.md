# Networking cont

## Cabling Devices & Ethernet

* Cables may be copper or fibre
* UTP uses pairs wires, twisted together. Some are for sending and others are for receiving
* Straight-through UTP connects a host to the switch, Crossover UTP connects host to each other
* Auto MDI-X detects UTP type and adapts if needed
* Full duplex send and recieve at the time. Half duplex take turns sending and receiving
* Dual core fibre is full duplex anf single fibre is half duplex
* Use Multi Mode Fibre(MMF) for a cheap shorter run, and Single Mode Fibre(SMF) for expensive longer run
* If cables are too restrictive, consider a wireless network.
* The ethernet protocol describes physical links, and how data is formatted
* 802.3(ethernet) - cables
* 802.11(WiFi) - Wireless

## Network Addressing

* Hosts in LAN have a MAC address and an IP address
* A MAC address is used within a LAN segment
* An IP is used within a segment, and to pass traffic to diffrent segments
