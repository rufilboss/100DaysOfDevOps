Before I am going to define how to encrypt S3 bucket using KMS, let get this thing out of the way S3 doesnâ€™t encrypt buckets, objects are encrypted and the setting are defined at an object level.

Earlier it was not possible to define encryption at a bucket level and there are many use cases to prevent uploads of unencrypted objects to an Amazon S3 bucket

To upload an object to S3, you use a Put request, regardless if called via the console, CLI, or SDK. The Put request looks similar to the following.

```sh
PUT /example-object HTTP/1.1
Host: myBucket.s3.amazonaws.com
Date: Wed, 8 Jun 2016 17:50:00 GMT
Authorization: authorization string
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 11434
x-amz-meta-author: Janet
Expect: 100-continue
[11434 bytes of object data]
```

* To encrypt an object at the time of upload, you need to add a header called x-amz-server-side-encryption to the request to tell S3 to encrypt the object using SSE-C, SSE-S3, or SSE-KMS. The following code example shows a Putrequest using SSE-S3.
