* What is AWS S3?

    AWS Simple Storage Service(S3) provides secure, durable and highly scalable object storage. S3 is easy to use and we can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

* Let’s create S3 bucket using terraform

```sh
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-test-s3-terraform-bucket"
  acl = "private"
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
  tags {
    Name = "my-test-s3-terraform-bucket"
  }
}
```

    bucket: name of the bucket, if we ommit that terraform will assign random bucket name
    acl: Default to Private(other options public-read and public-read-write)
    versioning: Versioning automatically keeps up with different versions of the same object.

###### NOTE: Every S3 bucket must be unique and that why random id is useful to prevent our bucket to collide with others.

###### LifeCycle Management

* Why do we need LifeCycle Management?

    * To save cost
    * In most of the cases, data which is generated by our application is relevant for us for the first 30 days and after that, we don’t access that data as frequently.
