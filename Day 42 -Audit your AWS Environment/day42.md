* How to Audit your AWS environment using tools like

    * AWS Trusted Advisor
    * Scout2

* What is AWS Trusted Advisor

    * AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides you real time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.

#### AWS Trusted Advisor

* Go to Trusted Advisor â†’ [**here**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/trustedadvisor)

    * Green: No issue or concern found
    * Yellow: Investigation is recommended
    * Red: Critical action recommended

* If you further expand the Trusted Advisor page and explore the details, anything which is not in red will list the criteria for details and recommended actions
* Open the security group, which is highlighted in red
* Change the Port 21 to only listen to your company IP range
* Refresh the security advisor and as you can see port 21 is no longer appear

###### NOTE: You can only refresh the status every 5 min, so if the refresh button is greyed out please wait for 5 min.

* This is the simple example of how you can use Trusted Advisor to fix security issues.

* Similarly, you can look for other security recommendation and fixed it.

#### Scout2

One other tool I will highly recommend everyone to use is Scout2 as it gives you much more detailed information for auditing purpose.

* Installation is pretty straightforward

    ```sh
    pip install awsscout2
    ```

* Export your keys

    ```sh
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=" "
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=" "
    ```

* Run it,

```sh

* In the end, you will get the nice UI interface

* For eg: If I click on EC2 and further drill down, similar to Trusted Advisor(you will see Green, Orange and Red)

* If you further drill down it will give you the detailed information
